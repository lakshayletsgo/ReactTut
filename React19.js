// Hooks in React 
// We use hook so that we can use the functions of class component in function component

// There are mainly 4 functions of hooks
// useState
// useEffect
// useContext
// useRef

// useState is used to state in functions
// useEffect is genenerally used in componentDidMount function and componentDidUpdate
// useRef is used to refer a space in DOM 
// useContext will be used later 
// We can use class and function component in same project
// After this we will start learning about MERN stack 
// We will learn about it so that we can make our own api
