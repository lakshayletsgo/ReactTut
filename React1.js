// This is the first react app writing page 
// We use npx to build this folder because it temporarily installs the library to create a folder while npm install the entire library and then build it 
// In react we use jsx which is html 
// It is a little different then html. There are only few lines where we have different name of the component
// In this path i will upload the code at the end of this file after the code summary


// The main file in react is App.js as it is one which is reloaded on the page
// The App.js is rendered using the help of JavaScript applied to a site 
// There are two types of component in React 
// 1. Function 
// 2. Class

// We will mostly use the function component and it can only return one element so will always enclose the entire jsx in tag
