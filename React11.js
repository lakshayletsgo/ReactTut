// This is the description of the project I have done so far
// Today is day 2 of making NewsMonkey
// Today we have added cards to add news which contains our news element
// We have used new api to get news 
// We have put the sample news to the outputSample.json file
// News will be recieved in a json format
// Now we have called props using this method

// let {title,description} = this.props

// This will get props in the name of title and description 
// We also got photos link in the json file 
// We can use this link to get the photo and put it in the cards of the news
// We will only make changes in the NewsItem component
// And we will get it changed all over other component
